Hi, I’m Lili. I’m currently a Master’s student in Cybersecurity at Temple University. I previously completed my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Hainan University, where I discovered my interest in Human-Centered Computing. In 2024, I founded the Huminex Lab, which I continue to lead today.
Grounded in an understanding of the mechanisms behind human cognition and behavior, my research focuses on designing intelligent systems that responsibly enhance human potential. These systems are not intended to automate or dictate human decision-making. Instead, they are built to subtly scaffold self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-growth. 
Using methods such as adaptive interventions and embodied technologies, I aim to empower human agency and help people move more consciously and freely.
