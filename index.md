# Introduction

The Huminex lab is a research group deeply committed to exploring how intelligent technologies can responsibly enhance human emotion, cognition, and behavior. The lab grew out of a student-led human-centered computing club started by Lili Zhang during her undergraduate years at Hainan University.

Our mission is to design adaptive and embodied systems to ethically intervene in human experience without diminishing autonomy, to enhance well-being and promote equitable humanâ€“technology futures.

Got ideas that broadly match our research goals? Come join us! Given our highly transdisciplinary focus, we warmly welcome individuals from diverse backgrounds including computer science, design, psychology, and cognitive science.

Our projects explore the intersection of human emotion, cognition, and intelligent systems. 
From EEG-powered smart headphones to VR-based social engineering and emotion-regulating wearable devices, we design technologies that respond to and support the complexity of human experience.
