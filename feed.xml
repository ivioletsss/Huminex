The lab grew out of an student-led human-centered computing club started by Lili Zhang during her undergraduate years at Hainan University. Our mission is to designing adaptive and embodied systems to ethically intervene in human experience without diminishing autonomy, to enhance well-being and promote equitable humanâ€“ technology futures.

However, few existing works examine cultural representativeness, especially involving whether the generated content can fairly and accurately reflect global cultures. Combining automated and human methods, we investigate this issue in multiple dimensions quantificationally and conduct a set of evaluations on three prevailing T2I models (DALL-E v2, Stable Diffusion v1.5 and v2.1). Introducing attributes of cultural cluster and subject, we provide a fresh interdisciplinary perspective to bias analysis. The benchmark dataset UCOGC is presented, which encompasses authentic images of unique cultural objects from global clusters.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
