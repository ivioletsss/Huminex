  The Huminex lab is a research group deeply committed to exploring how intelligent technologies can responsibly enhance human emotion, cognition, and behavior. The lab grew out of an
  student-led human-centered computing club started by Lili Zhang during her undergraduate years at Hainan University.
  Our mission is to designing adaptive and embodied systems to ethically intervene in human experience without diminishing autonomy, to enhance well-being and promote equitable humanâ€“
  technology futures.
